# 🔓 HackMeIfYouCan

**HackMeIfYouCan** is a self-developed vulnerable web application created to demonstrate and understand SQL Injection attacks — and how to fix them.  
It was built as part of my cybersecurity portfolio.

## ✨ Overview

This project simulates a basic login system vulnerable to SQL Injection.  
After successfully exploiting the vulnerability, I secured the code using proper query parameterization — giving me hands-on experience with both the offensive and defensive sides of cybersecurity.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- Python (Flask)
- SQLite
- Burp Suite
- HTML/CSS

---

## 🎯 What I Did

- Built a custom login app using Flask and SQLite
- Introduced a vulnerability intentionally (SQLi)
- Tested the attack using Burp Suite
- Implemented a secure fix using parameterized queries

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How real-world login systems can be exploited through SQL Injection
- How to intercept and modify web requests with Burp Suite
- The importance of secure coding practices
- A deeper understanding of ethical hacking and web app security
